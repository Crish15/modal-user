# modal-user
Simple page with a button that opens a modal on click.

After the first opening, a list of users is downloaded from a fake API.

Automatically, the first one from the list is selected, showing the chosen user's avatar, full name and e-mail.

You can switch between users by clicking on the list displayed below the profile section. The currently selected user is highlighted over the rest

At the bottom of the modal there is a toolbar where you can set the size of the list and regenerate the data.
If the chosen quantity is greater than 20 or less than 0, an error message is displayed.
